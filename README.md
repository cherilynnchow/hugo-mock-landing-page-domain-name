# Repository info

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish the website whenever changes are made to the code. First, it says that whenever we push (update) code to the "main" branch of the repository, this set of instructions should run. Next, it checks out (downloads) all the code and files needed to build the website, including any themes or other components. Then, it sets up the Hugo environment, which is a tool used to build static websites. It specifies the version of Hugo to use (0.123.4) and enables some extra features. After that, it runs the Hugo command to actually build the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). It includes some options like minifying (compressing) the files and allowing draft content. Finally, it takes all those built website files and publishes them to the "gh-pages" branch of the repository. This "gh-pages" branch is special - GitHub will automatically serve the contents of this branch as a website at **https://cherilynn.college/**.
